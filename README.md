### Near-term forecasting to inform environmental flows

#### Overview

This repository contains code to forecast native fish population outcomes under
a range of near-term climate and management scenarios. The purpose of these 
forecasts is to inform future deliveries of environmental flows in the 
Murray-Darling Basin and coastal-draining rivers in south-eastern Australia.

Data sets to support analyses are stored on a private database and access to
this database is currently required to reproduce the analysis. A minimal
data set necessary to re-run analyses and reproduce all outputs will be
provided on manuscript submission.


#### Usage

The `main.R` script runs all analyses and generates all outputs. Note that
data loading and simulations are computationally intensive (depending on 
simulation settings) and may take hours or days.


#### Contact

Any errors, bugs, or queries should be logged using the GitHub Issues tracker.
